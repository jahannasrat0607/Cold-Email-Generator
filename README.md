ðŸ“§ Cold Email Generator
Cold email generator for service-based businesses using Groq, LangChain, and Streamlit. This tool enables users to input a company's careers page URL, extract job listings, and generate customized cold emails. These emails include relevant portfolio links retrieved from a vector database, ensuring they align with the job descriptions.

Use Case Example
Imagine this scenario:

TechNova Solutions, a software development company, wants to reach out to potential clients. They identify that Puma is hiring a Principal Software Engineer. Instead of Puma spending time and resources on recruitment, TechNova Solutions offers to provide a dedicated software engineer to handle Puma's projects.

A business development executive (e.g., Prabhat from TechNova) can use this tool to craft a personalized cold email tailored to Puma's job listing, significantly improving engagement and response rates.
